# PRODUCTS
Products. is a little JavaFx game where you become wealthy. 
You can build devices, buy and transform resources and sell them with a better price ! 
You will be able to download on my website (not open yet).

_If you found some grammaticals errors anywhere (in this file, in the game...), please report it to me so that I can correct it quickly. But don't blame me, I'm not a native english speaker._

## Introduction
Products. is my first JavaFX project. I'm working on this since July 2019. I do everything on my own : source code, images, stylesheets...

## Downloading and Installation
You can't actually download the game, but you can clone this repository. I'm open to suggestions (even better with source code).
You will find more information on the game on the websites once it is open (I haven't done anything yet).

## API
I will do an API for the game, I want that anybody can do a plugin for the game, so I'll implement the feature a little bit later on.

**Don't forget to leave a star and watch this project :)**

Oh! If you find some weird things in this repo, it is normal. I had not Git (and GitHub) when I began this porject, 
the initial commit is in the middle of nowhere. The same way, I managed to convert it to a Maven project...
You know, those things may be tricky sometimes.
